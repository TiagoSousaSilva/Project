# Project
The "Cybersecurity" project involves configuring different services and implementing security measures on the AWS platform. The primary focus is on enhancing cybersecurity aspects across various network functionalities.

The project begins with setting up an insecure FTP server on the 'ftpsrv' machine. A specific user is created for accessing the FTP server, and Filezilla is used to demonstrate the server's accessibility. Additionally, the Onion server is utilized to test the system's vulnerability by attempting to discover the user and password information.

To ensure accurate and synchronized time across the network, the NTP server is centralized. Remnux is designated as the central time source, acquiring time from the Internet, and all other machines within the network obtain time from Remnux.

The project also includes the installation and configuration of an MIB browser on Remnux. Subsequently, SNMP is activated on the other machines, and the MIB browser is utilized to visualize the contents of these machines.

Furthermore, the project involves setting up a centralized Syslog server on Remnux, which will demonstrate the logs from all machines in a centralized manner.

Lastly, the project involves establishing a site-to-site VPN. This secure communication channel enables encrypted data transmission and seamless connectivity between multiple locations within the network.

Through the successful completion of these tasks, the "Cybersecurity" project aims to create a well-secured and efficiently configured network infrastructure within the AWS platform, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of various network services and cybersecurity practices.
